# Base Components

Provider-agnostic component definitions live here:
- namespaces
- cert-manager
- cert-manager/issuers
- cilium
- metrics-server
- runtime-inputs
- oauth2-proxy
- clickstack
- clickstack-bootstrap
- otel
- storage/minio
- storage/ceph
- apps/example

Legacy `core/` and `platform/` placeholder directories were removed; active ownership is component-level paths only.
