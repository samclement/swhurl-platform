# Base Components

Provider-agnostic component definitions should live here.

Current component scaffold:
- namespaces
- cert-manager
- cilium
- oauth2-proxy
- clickstack
- otel
- storage/minio
- storage/ceph
- apps/example

Transitional note:
- `core/` and `platform/` remain as temporary aggregation placeholders while migration
  moves to per-component ownership.
